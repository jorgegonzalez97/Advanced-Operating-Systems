# Advanced-Operating-Systems

Prog1 - Create a client - server program in which multiple clients can download files from the server simultaneously

Prog2 - Create a peer2peer program in which clients can download and send simultaneously files between them with help of an indexing server

Prog3 - Create a distributed system with strong and weak peers in which the weak peers search files between them with the help of the strong 
        peers to which they are connected and download the files connecting directly to them.
        
Prog4 - Same than Prog2 but the files are sent and received in many chunks from different peers.
